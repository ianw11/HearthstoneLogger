To run this, you first need to enable logging in Hearthstone.

OS X:

   1. cd to ~/Library/Preferences/Blizzard/Hearthstone/
   2. Create log.config
   3. The file should have the following (except with no spaces in the file - left justified):
      [Power]
      LogLevel=1
      FilePrinting=false
      ConsolePrinting=true
      ScreenPrinting=false

      [Zone]
      LogLevel=1
      FilePrinting=false
      ConsolePrinting=true
      ScreenPrinting=false
   4. Then restart (or start) Hearthstone

Windows:

   1. Unknown currently, will check back later




Once logging is enabled, you can run jar.sh to combile the files, create a single jar, and run the jar to start logging.
